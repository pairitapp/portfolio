    <h1>Python</h1>

    <p>
        I began learning Python over two years ago. This language has shown me
        how programming can be useful to facilitate everyday life.

                The StocksCorrelation project was created to study the correlation
                between various stocks in the different industries. <br><br>On the left

                industries that was analysed.

                The Earthquakes Analysis project was created to study the link between
                the intensity and the location of earthquakes through a KNN method. <br><br>This project
                taught me how supervised machine learning can be used in real life applications, 
                to meaningfully study important questions. <br><br>
                <b>Technologies used</b> <br>
                sci-kit learn, k-nearest neighbours regression, matplotlib, pandas, numpy

            <p>
                I created the Asset Allocation project was created to learn more about the applications
                of computer science and mathematics and the world of finance using historical stock data
                and the <b>Sharpe ratio</b> and the <b>Monte Carlo method</b>.
                <br><br>
                The scatterplot shows the annualized return and the standard deviation
                of each portfolio generated through the Monte Carlo method. This plot
                demonstrates the concept of the <b>efficient frontier</b> in portfolio
                optimization.
                <br><br>
                The second plot is an example of the performance of one of the portfolios
                that was generated. 
                <br><br>
                When ran, the program prints out a table of the portfolios
                sorted by their Sharpe ratio. We can see in that table the weight the various stocks 
                have to obtain this ratio.
