                A few months ago, I wanted to start learning a new language. To do so, one must
                learn vocabulary. I could not find any app or website that helped me learn
                new words in an interactive way, so I made one!
            
                <h2>
                    Technologies Used
                </h2>
            
                The app was made with <b>SwiftUI</b> using XCode. This app taught me the
                importance of teamwork, visual design and data management. Furthermore, I
                learned a lot in the field of <b>language learning</b>. I had to figure out the optimal
                way humans learn languages and what I found was the concept of <b>spaced repetition</b>,
                which is implemented in this app.

                <br><br>
                The data used used in the app was scraped and formatted through <b>Python</b>. I
                scraped every single book available on the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org" target="_blank">Gutenberg Project Website</a> 
                (more than 60 000) which resulted in a JSON file of about 60 GB. I then filtered out any books which weren't written in
                English and created a sorted frequency list of these words and kept the top 2000.
                These words were then translated in 100+ languages.
